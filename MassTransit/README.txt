# Mass Transit

## Notes
MTA.pdf, OCTA.pdf, MTA.sl3, and OCTA.sl3 must be downloaded and added to the project
They have been removed in order to reduce file size, however are referenced within Xcode.

## Bugs
1. Zooming in on the map pdf multiple times currently causes the map to disappear
2. OCTA not fully implemented
